# IoT-Smart-Irrigation-System
The main objective of this project is to provide an automatic Smart  Irrigation System to minimize the number of workers in a crop field,  control and save water and electricity, increase agricultural production  using small quantities of water, minimize manual intervention in  watering operations with increasing watering speed.

# OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT  
➢ Simplify the irrigation system by installing and designing the whole 
irrigation system.
➢ Save energy
➢ Optimize water consumption 
➢ Completely automize the system
➢ Decrease the cost of operation 
➢ Make system easy to use by farmers

# ALGORITHM
Step 1: initialize ESP8266 and connect to WIFI, establish 
communication with Arduino via Software Serial.
Step 2: Obtain temperature and humidity values and publish it to 
thingspeak 
Step 3: Check if soil moisture is above threshold and irrigate the plants if 
it is not raining 
Step 4: Check water level and alert user if it is low 
Step 5: Go back to Step 1
